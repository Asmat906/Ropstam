# ropstam_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Three Task were Assigned To me.
1:Login API
2:Get API
3:User session managment

Flow of App:

When You open a screen will open with three task.
1:Click on Task1
Now when we click on this a login page will open to us where we put the credential as get for API

Login Api: http://buddy.ropstambpo.com/api/login
Params: email, password & device_token
Request Type: Post
Credentials:  
email = hassan.zafar@ropstam.com                    
password=12345678     

When we login with this We go to another screen where the detail of user shown in list view.
Design all the response which is coming on user login.

Task2:
Now go back and click on the Task 2 option, so this is a get api where we just the response from the API and showing
the data in listview.
So you can test the data.
API:Post Details Api: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/Posts
Request type: Get
Call this api on the home screen and display data in the list view.

Task3:
Task 3 is applied in Task2 option, when we login and go to next screen of USER detail screen, there in app bar a logout icon,
when we click on that so it route us back to the first page. also user session applied ,when we terminate,or kill the app the app will start from the first screen where we have the option of tasks, if the app run in background so it will stay on user page.

Thanks
